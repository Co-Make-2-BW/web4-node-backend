# "I want to take a better look at your Repo, how would I do that?"

Good question!
First, "Fork" & "Clone" the Repo to your Local Repository.

Next, run
```
npm i
```
to install all of the dependencies from the package.json

Afterwards, run
```
npm start
```
Which will start the server on localhost:5000

# "I want to run your TESTS for your Users, Auth, and API - How would I do that?"

Good question!
After you have the dependencies installed, you can run
```
npm test
```
which will run Jest and it'll read the .spec.js test files, run the tests, and return 10 passing tests.
